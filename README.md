<h1>Covid 19 Global Data</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is a website I created using HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript, while learning to fetch data from REST APIs.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This website shows both global and countrywise data about Coronavirus, i.e., Total Covid 19 Cases, Active Covid 19 cases, Covid related Deaths, Recoveries, Death Ratio, Recovery Ratio and number of people Tested for coronavirus until now. It also shows data about the various Vaccines from around the world that are under development or phased trials, as well as the vaccines that have been authorized for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Authority. The data for all of this is fetched using two different REST APIs.</p>
<h3>APIs used in the project</h3>
<p>The APIs used in this website are <i>Coronavirus Map</i> and <i>VACCOVID</i>, both provided by <a href='https://rapidapi.com/'>RapidAPI.</a></p>
